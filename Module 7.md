6.	Return 0
 
Program:
```
#include <stdio.h>

struct eligible {
    int age;
    char n[50];
};

int main() {
    int i, num;

    printf("Enter number of persons: ");
    scanf("%d", &num);

    struct eligible e[num];

    for (i = 0; i < num; i++) {
        printf("\nEnter name: ");
        scanf("%s", e[i].n);
        printf("Enter age: ");
        scanf("%d", &e[i].age);

        if (e[i].age <= 6)
            printf("Vaccine Eligibility: No\n");
        else
            printf("Vaccine Eligibility: Yes\n");
    }

    printf("\n--- Details ---\n");
    for (i = 0; i < num; i++) {
        printf("Name: %s  Age: %d\n", e[i].n, e[i].age);
    }

    return 0;

    FILE *p;
    char name[50];

    printf("Enter file name: ");
    scanf("%s", name);

    printf("File %s created successfully\n", name);

    p = fopen(name, "w");

    if (p == NULL) {
        printf("Error in creating file\n");
        return 1;

Ex No 5 : C PROGRAM TO DISPLAY STUDENT DETAILS USING STRUCTURE

Aim:
The aim of this program is to dynamically allocate memory to store information about multiple subjects (name and marks), input the details for each subject, and then display the stored information. Finally, it frees the allocated memory to prevent memory leaks.

Algorithm:
1.Input the number of subjects.

2.Read the integer value n from the user, which represents the number of subjects.

3.Dynamically allocate memory:

4.Use malloc to allocate memory for n subjects. Each subject has a name (array of characters) and marks (integer).

5.If memory allocation fails (i.e., the pointer s is NULL), display an error message and exit the program.

6.Input the details of each subject

7.Use a for loop to read the name and marks of each subject using scanf. For each subject, store the name as a string and marks as an integer in the dynamically allocated memory.

8.Display the details of each subject

9.Use another for loop to print the name and marks of each subject.

10.Free the allocated memory

11.After all operations are done, call free(s) to release the dynamically allocated memory.

12.Return from the main function

13.End the program by returning 0.

Program:
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct subject {
    char name[50];
    int marks;
};

int main() {
    int n, i;
    struct subject *s;

    printf("Enter number of subjects: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    s = (struct subject*)malloc(n * sizeof(struct subject));

    if (s == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed\n");
        return 1;
    }

    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("Enter subject name: ");
        scanf("%s", s[i].name);
        printf("Enter marks: ");
        scanf("%d", &s[i].marks);
    }

    printf("\n--- Subject Details ---\n");
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("Subject: %s  Marks: %d\n", s[i].name, s[i].marks);
    }

    free(s);
    return 0;
}
```
